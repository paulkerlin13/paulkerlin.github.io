This lab is about using SPARTA to automate security analysis. It covers starting an analysis of a subnet, gaining access to MySQL, brute-forcing access to a machine, analyzing Nikto results, accessing and closing backdoor shells, and mounting a remote NFS share.

* Subnet Analysis: Using SPARTA to discover hosts and run various scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities.
* MySQL Access: Identifying and accessing an unprotected MySQL database.
* Brute-Force Attack: Using Hydra, a brute-force tool, to guess passwords and gain access to a machine.
* Nikto Analysis: Using Nikto to scan for web server vulnerabilities.
* Backdoor Access: Accessing and closing a backdoor shell on a compromised system.
* NFS Share Mounting: Mounting a remote NFS share and accessing files.
