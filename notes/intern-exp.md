# My Internship Experiences: From IT Support to Building Machine Learning Clusters

My internship journey has given me the chance to experience two very different sides of technology, from basic IT operations to systems engineering with datacenter infrastructure for a **machine learning cluster**. I have gained hands-on education that no classroom can replicate and reshaped the way I think about how technology really works.

### Whiting-Turner: Learning the Fundamentals

At **The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company**, I started with the fundamentals: imaging systems, applying patches, deploying endpoint protection, and managing user tickets. That experience taught me the essentials of how technology behaves in a real-world environment. Being able to apply things I have learned in school to a real environment helped reinforce my understanding of so many different topics. Supporting real users and resolving technical issues in a production environment forced me to think critically about **root causes, reliability, and the human side of technology**.

### Visionary Technologies: Scaling Infrastructure

The following summer I joined **Visionary Technologies**, where the work looked completely different but built on the same foundation. I helped assemble and configure over 80 server and network racks for a large-scale **machine learning cluster for the DoD**. I ran cabling, installed switches, and configured hardware in one of the most technically complex infrastructures I’ve ever seen. That’s when I realized that **infrastructure is the backbone of everything**.

### Takeaway

You don’t fully appreciate the cloud until you’ve helped build it. Working at this level showed me that **cybersecurity, AI, and all of modern computing rely on the same thing — secure, resilient, and well-designed infrastructure**. It’s not something you truly learn in school, but after having hands-on experience I have gained a new level of understanding and appreciation for it.
