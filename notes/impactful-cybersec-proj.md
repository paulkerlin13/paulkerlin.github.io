# My Most Impactful Cybersecurity Projects

Throughout my time at Penn State and in my personal homelab, I’ve taken on projects that pushed me to think like both an attacker and a defender. Each project has taught me something new about technology, teamwork, and the importance of translating theory into practice.

### Network Segmentation with pfSense

In one project, I deployed and configured a **pfSense firewall** to segment networks and improve perimeter security. Setting up VLANs, NAT rules, and intrusion detection systems showed me how **configuration choices impact both security and usability**. It taught me that security isn’t just about adding layers but also about designing systems that balance performance, protection, and practicality.

### Governance and Risk Integration

Another project I’m proud of involved integrating **ISO/IEC 27000 standards** with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**. Working as part of a team, we created a governance model that aligned regulatory compliance (**HIPAA, GDPR**) with real-world risk management principles. It was my first time bridging the gap between policy and technology, and it gave me a much deeper appreciation for **frameworks as actual tools — not just checklists**.

### Incident Response and Business Continuity

Finally, in an **incident response and business continuity** project, I helped design recovery playbooks for a simulated enterprise. We created strategies for handling **cyberattacks, natural disasters, and operational disruptions**, from technical containment to executive communication. It showed me how cybersecurity decisions carry across an entire organization.

### Takeaway

Each of these projects reinforced that cybersecurity isn’t about one skill but about **understanding how everything connects**.
